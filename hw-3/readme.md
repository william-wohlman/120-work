  I created and experimented with my first java p5 file. I decieded to check on the accessibility of what i already know about java. My conclusion was the relisation that this is a purly graphical display and doesnt take some if all of the code i already know.

  in addition, the use of variable declarations and the terminology for methods and classes is different. I want to try to use these in my CSCI class.
